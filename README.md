This repository demonstrates a subtle yet impactful error in COBOL programs involving data type mismatches during the MOVE operation. The primary focus is on scenarios where implicit type conversion isn't handled gracefully, leading to unpredictable program behavior or runtime failures. The solution provided emphasizes explicit type conversion and robust data validation to mitigate such risks and ensure code reliability.
